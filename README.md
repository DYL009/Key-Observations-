# Key-Observations-


Key Observations from the Plots:
1. Revenue and Net Income Over Years (First Plot):
Revenue Growth:

There has been a steady increase in revenue from 2009 to 2024.
Significant jumps occurred in 2015 and post-2020, showing accelerated growth during those periods.
Revenue peaked around 2023, with a slight dip afterward.
Net Income Trends:

Net Income shows a similar trend to revenue but remains significantly lower.
After 2020, Net Income increased sharply, peaking around 2022, followed by a slight decline.
Compared to revenue, Net Income has more fluctuations, indicating variations in operational costs, taxes, or other expenses.
Comparison:

The widening gap between Revenue and Net Income in the later years suggests increased costs, investments, or expenses impacting profitability.
2. EPS and Stock Price Over Years (Second Plot):
Stock Price Growth:

Stock Price showed steady growth until 2018 and then surged significantly post-2020.
Major jumps occurred between 2019–2021 and 2022–2024, indicating strong investor confidence or improved market performance.
EPS (Earnings Per Share):

EPS remained relatively flat for most years until 2021, when it started increasing gradually.
This upward trend aligns with the growth in Net Income and indicates better returns for shareholders.
Key Correlation:

Stock Price increases significantly outpaced EPS growth.
This could indicate increased market speculation, optimism, or future growth expectations driving up stock prices despite slower EPS growth.
Overall Takeaways:
Strong Financial Growth:
Both Revenue and Net Income grew significantly over the years, especially post-2020. Revenue has shown a more consistent upward trend.

Profitability Variations:
While Revenue is increasing steadily, Net Income shows more volatility, possibly due to operational or market costs.

Market Optimism:
Stock Prices surged dramatically, particularly in recent years, signaling high investor confidence and growth expectations.

Slight Decline in Recent Years:
Both Net Income and EPS have shown minor declines after 2022, which may reflect slowing growth or external challenges.

This analysis highlights a company experiencing robust growth while facing challenges in maintaining profitability proportionate to revenue growth. The stock market continues to price in optimism despite slower EPS growth.
